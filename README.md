## Prerequisites
- Python
- Tensorflow
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Getting started
### train altitude-based RL model

Train with the command line:
```
python agent_cap.py --topology ...
```

See more training options with `python agent_cap.py --help`

### train Learning-To-Route model

Train with the command line:
```
python agent.py --topology ...
```
